# Room-populate [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/motorro/room-populate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/motorro/room-populate) ![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/room-populate)
Room-populate is a small Node.js library to pre-populate Room database for Android as described in 
[Room documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/prepopulate).

## Introduction
See [room-populate-demo](https://github.com/motorro/room-populate-demo) project to see it in action

## Usage
Installation:
```shell script
npm install --save-dev room-populate
```
There is a single template-function `populate`:
```typescript
    async  function createDb() {
        const db: Database = new Database("db.db");

        await populate("app/scr/schemas/1.json", db, function(this: Database): Promise<void> {
            return new Promise<void>(function(resolve, reject) {
                this.exec("INSERT INTO `playlists` (id, title, genre) VALUES (1, 'SAMPLE', 'JAZZ')", (err) => {
                    if (err) {
                        reject(err);
                    } else {
                        resolve();
                    }
                });
            });
        });

        db.close();
    }
```
The function performs:
1.  Reads your schema
2.  Sets-up a database with room setup
3.  Creates tables
4.  Populates tables with your statements supplied to `populate`
5.  Creates indices
6.  Creates views

If you need to alter creation/population order use `RoomDbCreator` to perform actions the way you prefer.
